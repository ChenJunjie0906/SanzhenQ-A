## 1. Project Introduction

This project implements a **knowledge graph construction pipeline for Jin Sanzhen acupuncture therapy**, including:

1. PDF text extraction (OCR)  
2. LLM-based automatic structured annotation  
3. Merging and deduplication of annotation results (full pipeline)  
4. Knowledge graph construction and visualization based on Neo4j  

`main_demo.py` provides a **lightweight demo pipeline** that demonstrates the end-to-end core idea from **PDF → annotation → graph construction**, without exposing any full, copyrighted datasets.

## 2. Directory Structure (Overview)

Core directory structure related to the demo (simplified):

```text
repo_root/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   │   ├── pdf_demo/                   # PDFs used for the demo
│   │   │   └── 靳三针结合体针治疗外展神经麻痹的临床疗效观察_蒲宁.pdf
│   │   └── processed/                  # Manually / pre-processed structured samples
│   │       ├── GBT+12346-2021_demo.jsonl
│   │       ├── 靳三针穴组使用.jsonl

│       └── temp_pages/                 # Generated by demo: page-level intermediate files
└── src/
    └── jin_sanzhen_kg/
        ├── main_demo.py                # Demo entry point
        ├── extract_text.py             # PDFBatchExtractor: PDF text extraction (OCR)
        ├── batch_auto_label.py         # BatchAutoLabeler: batch LLM annotation
        ├── build_graph.py              # AcuKGBuilder: Neo4j graph construction
        ├── merge_dedup_labels.py       # LabelMerger: merge & dedup annotations (full pipeline)
        └── ...
```
Note: src and data are sibling directories, so in main_demo.py the repository root is located by going three levels up.
